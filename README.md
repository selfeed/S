Shadow-world. Only you and me, no Server.

What?
-----------
This project is rebuilding Internet based on P2P schema instead of browser-server schema.

We do not want suffer going on and potential harms from Servers.

We decide to take responsibility of ourself, let server go away from our life.

This project try to provide new P2P methods to connect and communicate between each other on internet.



Some ideas
-------------

All resources should be re-encrypted by itself SHA1024 digest, so you need just need share digest, not have to remember any password. ISP , Storage provider and hackers can copy it, cache it, proxy it, exclude make any value of it.

One person can own multi RSA keys, for different security level, different identity, different purpose,  and so on.

A group can share serval group keys between members.

Messages should be append with author's sign or several group-shared sign, so persons can calculate it's reliability.

Messages should also be append with several digest of recently messages, so we can reduce its publish time.

Person can split his private key into many pieces and distribute to his reliable friends, once he lost his key, he can make phones to friends, and recollect pieces into key.

Any software should be an open source software. All data should stored in person's device, or Internet after encrypted.

If any organization need statistics data, he should purchase it from end-user. Person use reliable software process self data, excluding privacy information,and anything at will. Sometimes person should use group key instead of private key.



Terminal device should provide a more friendly space, instead of GUI. 
Person may have  their house in self virtual space,and place resource in different rooms at their will.
